Hi there. I'm Arpit Saxena, currently a student at IIT Delhi pursuing a B.Tech. in Mathematics and Computing.
I made this blog primarily so I could have a better understanding of things by writing about them, and consequently sharing the stuff I learnt.
There would primarily be stuff related to things software related, but no guarantees to the quality :P
