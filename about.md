Hi there. I'm Arpit Saxena, currently a student at IIT Delhi pursuing a B.Tech. in Mathematics and Computing.
I made this blog primarily so I could have a better understanding of things by writing about them, and consequently sharing the stuff I learnt.
This is primarily meant as a journal (for the lack of vocabulary) for me to write about stuff. I'll try to give some background but obviously
I can't give out all of it, so the posts would require some background knowledge to be understandable.
There would primarily be stuff related to things software related, but no guarantees to the quality :P
